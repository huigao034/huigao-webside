        <p class="lead mb-4">Research Assistant at Life Events Lab, University of California, Riverside. Currently working on two study that ruling in the lab. Toxin Risk Assessment, in this particular task, as a research assistant, I run studies with introductory psychology students in the lab. Also Run studies off-campus at clinics and hospitals. Attend weekly meetings with Dr. Sweeny and her graduate students to discuss lab issues, research, and graduate school and career options. Help to brainstorm new studies or changes to ongoing studies. At the same time pilot test procedures and measures.<br><br>
        My personal passion is psychology. The reason I got involved in this area is that I have always been fascinated with human behavior and understanding how the mind works. The study of psychology is about mental processing and how it affects a person's current and future disposition in order to empower individuals to lead better lives. As I mentioned before, I attended boarding school from first grade until my sophomore year of high school. I have a complete understanding of how it feels to be alone. This feeling led me to become fascinated with psychology. It made me think of  those who struggle with mental health and how they live in society. It‚Äôs hard for many of them to feel loved, so I hope one day to use my limited influence to give them unlimited love by helping them to learn how to deal with mental health problems.
<br><br>
I am truly passionate about psychology and would eventually like to pursue a career in that field. In the future, I would like to be a counselor for two to three years to build a strong connection with my patients. Another reason that I would like to be a counselor first is that I would be able to walk in the patients‚Äô shoes and understand their feelings in order to get more experience. After that I would like to attend a Chinese university to do research and teach others  to use different methods to help more people deal with mental health problems and remain true to my original aspirations.

<br><br>
Psychology is a field that needs to be developed in China. People in China used to refuse to admit to mental problems. They felt it was shameful to see a counselor or even ask for help. Also, there were not a lot of counselors in China. If there were counselors, they didn‚Äôt have the correct qualifications to be a counselor. However, the psychology field in China has significantly developed in recent years, but it still has a lot of room for improvement. In my opinion, the main solution to this problem is to cultivate more talent in this field. This is why my final occupational goal is to end up as a psychology professor in a Chinese university.
<br><br>
        I am an independent, hard working and trustworthy young adult who sees herself as a life-long learner, in order to absorb knowledge and experiences from each person that have interacted with her in her life.
